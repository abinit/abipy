These DDB files are produced by the following Abinit tutorials:

- tutorespfn_tlw_1-tlw_2-tlw_3/ 
- tutorespfn_tlw_4-tlw_5-tlw_6-tlw_7/tlw_5.abo

The DDB files are used in the AbiPy tests to exercise the ddb methods 
associated to the treatment of the dynamical quadrupoles.
The AbiPy interface for the postprocessing of the flexoelectric tensor is not yet implemented.
