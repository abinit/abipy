# PRO TIP: the scheduler WILL try to send and email after a default time of 4 days. If you 
#          comment out the mailto address, this will cause the scheduler to terminate, with
#          potentially nefarious effects on your running jobs. If you do not wish to receive
#          emails, a work around is to set the variable `remindme_s` below to something very
#          large (say, 100 days).
