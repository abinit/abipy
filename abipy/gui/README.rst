gui examples
============

Below is a brief description of the different directories found here:

  * awx - contains generic widgets used to construct more complicated interfaces.

  * wxFormBuilder - wxFormBuilder input file used to design some of of the UI.

  * demo - Scripts showing the different widgets/applications 


If you add a new widget/application, add a new script in the demo directory.
Name the script following the conventions demo_awx_[namewidgetn] so that 
run.py can import and run it automatically.
