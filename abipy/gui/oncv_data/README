Preliminary set of input files for generating NC pseudopotentials with oncvpsp code.

Naming scheme:

Symbol[-spdf][-so][-gw|..][-low|-high]
      [1]    [2]  [3]   [4]

where

[1]: Angular channels included in the semicore. Empty if no semicore is included.
[2]: By default, all pseudos are generated with the scalar-relativistic version.
     unless the spin-orbit flag -so is present
[3]: Flag specifying if the pseudo has been optimized for GW calculations.
[4]: Accuracy flag. Possible values: "low", "high"
