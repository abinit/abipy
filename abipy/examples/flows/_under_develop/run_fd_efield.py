FOO BAR
==========================

Flow to compute with finite differences.

Finite electric field calculation of AlP at clamped atomic positions

Here the polarization of the cell is computed as a function of increasing
external homogeneous electric field.

berryopt 4 is used to trigger the finite field calculation, while
the efield variable sets the strength (in atomic units) and direction of the field

Based on tutorespfn/Input/tpolarization_6.abi
