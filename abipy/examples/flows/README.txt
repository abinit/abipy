Flow Gallery
============

This gallery contains python scripts to generate AbiPy flows from the command line.

Run the scripts to generate the directory with the flow and then use :ref:`abirun.py` to execute the flow.
Alternatively, one can use the ``-s`` option to generate the flow and run it immediately with the scheduler. 
Use ``--help`` for further information on the available options.

.. warning::

    The following examples show how to use python and the AbiPy API to generate and run 
    Abinit calculations in a semi-automatic way. 
    These examples are not supposed to produce physically meaningful results 
    as input parameters are usually underconverged.
