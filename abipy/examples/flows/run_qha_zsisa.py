Flow for ZSISA calculations
===========================

This examples shows how to compute temperature-dependent lattice parameters,
thermal expansion coefficients and relaxed-ions temperature-dependent elastic constants
using the ZSISA-QHA method. External pressure can be included as well.

By incorporating second-order derivatives of the vibrational free energy with respect
to lattice degrees of freedom, one can significantly reduce the number of
required phonon band structure calculations.
See <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09531>.

This AbiPy flow performs the following operations:

1) The initial structure is relaxed and a minimum set of deformed configurations is generated.

2) The atomic positions in the deformed structures are relaxed at fixed cell,
   and the relaxed configurations are then used to compute phonons, Born-effective charges,
   the electronic dielectric tensor (eps_inf), and dynamical, quadrupoles with DFPT.

3) Phonon DOSes are computed for all the deformed structures by interpolating the interatomic
   forces constants on a much denser q-mesh, and the results are used to compute the thermal stresse.

4) An iterative process is used for determining lattice parameters at temperature T and external pressure P.
   The process begins with an initial guess for the lattice configuration,
   followed by the computation of thermal and BO stresses.
   A target stress is defined based on thermal stress and P, and the lattice and atomic positions
   are relaxed iteratively until the target stress matches the BO stress and the BO forces are zeroed,
   ensuring convergence to the optimal lattice configuration.

5) Finally, relaxed-ions elastic constants for the thermal-relaxed configurations
   are optionally computed with DFPT.

The final results are stored in the ``outdata`` directory of the flow.
Two files are produced at the end of the run:

zsisa_data.csv:

    lattice parameters, thermal expansion, and elastic tensor components for each T and P in CSV format.

ZsisaResults.json:

    JSON file with the location of the different files (GSR.nc, DDB) on the filesystem.
    To reconstruct a python object from file, use:

```
        from abipy.zsisa import ZsisaResults
        data = ZsisaResults.json_load("ABSPATH_TO_FILE")

        # Post-processing methods.
        data.get_dataframe()
        data.plot_lattice_vs_temp()
        data.plot_thermal_expansion()
```
