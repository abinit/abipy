Flow for phonons with DFPT
==========================

This example shows how to compute the phonon band structure of AlAs with AbiPy flows.
Symmetries are taken into account: only q-points in the IBZ are generated and
for each q-point only the independent atomic perturbations are computed.
The final results (out_DDB, out_DVDB) will be produced automatically at the end of the run
and saved in ``flow_phonons/outdata/``.
