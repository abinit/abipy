AbiPy Gallery
=============

There are a variety of ways to use the AbiPy post-processing tools, 
and most of them are illustrated in the examples in this directory.

Remember that one can also generate a jupyter notebook directly from the command line with 
the :ref:`abiopen.py` script and the command::

    abiopen.py FILE -nb

issue 

    abiopen.py FILE --expose

to generate plots automatically or use one of the options of :ref:`abiview.py` to plot the results automatically.
