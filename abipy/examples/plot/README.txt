AbiPy Gallery
=============

There are a variety of ways to use the AbiPy post-processing tools,
and some of them are illustrated in the examples in this directory.
These examples represent an excellent starting point if you need  to implement
a customized script to solve your particular problem.
Keep in mind, however, that simple visualization tasks can be easily 
automated by just issuing in the terminal::

    abiopen.py FILE --expose

to generate a predefined list of **matplotlib** plots.
To activate the plotly version (if available) use:

.. code-block:: shell

    abiopen.py FILE --plotly

Note also that one can generate jupyter-lab notebooks directly from the command line with
abiopen.py_ and the command::

    abiopen.py FILE -nb

Add `--classic-notebook` if you prefer classic jupyter notebooks.

Finally, use one of the options of the abiview.py_ script to plot the results automatically.
