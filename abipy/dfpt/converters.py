    Converts the interatomic force constants(IFC), born effective charges(BEC) and dielectric

    standard phonopy files to a selected directory: FORCE_CONSTANTS, BORN (if BECs are available)
    POSCAR of the unit cell, POSCAR of the supercell.

    The conversion is performed taking the IFC in the Wignerâ€“Seitz supercell with weights
    as produced by anaddb and reorganizes them in a standard supercell multiple of the
    unit cell. Operations are vectorized using numpy. This may lead to the allocation of
    large arrays in case of very large supercells.

    Performs a check to verify if the two codes identify the same symmetries and it gives a
    warning in case of failure. Mismatching symmetries may lead to incorrect conversions.

    Args:
        anaddbnc: an instance of AnaddbNcFile. Should contain the output of the IFC analysis,
            the BEC and the dielectric tensor.
        supercell_matrix: the supercell matrix used for phonopy. Any choice is acceptable, however
            the best agreement between the abinit and phonopy results is obtained if this is set to
            a diagonal matrix with on the diagonal the ngqpt used to generate the anaddb.nc.
        symmetrize_tensors: if True the tensors will be symmetrized in the Phonopy object and
            in the output files. This will apply to IFC, BEC and dielectric tensor.
        output_dir_path: a path to a directory where the phonopy files will be created
        prefix_outfiles: a string that will be added as a prefix to the name of the written files
        symprec: distance tolerance in Cartesian coordinates to find crystal symmetry in phonopy.
            It might be that the value should be tuned so that it leads to the the same symmetries
            as in the abinit calculation.
        set_masses: if True the atomic masses used by abinit will be added to the PhonopyAtoms
            and will be present in the returned Phonopy object. This should improve compatibility
            among abinit and phonopy results if frequencies needs to be calculated.

    Converts the data from phonopy to an abinit DDB file. The data can be provided
    in form of arrays or paths to the phonopy files that should be parsed.
    The minimal input should contains the FORCE_CONSTANTS or FORCE_SETS.
    If BORN is present the Born effective charges (BEC) and dielectric
    tensor will also be added to the DDB.

    The best agreement is obtained with supercell_matrix and ngqpt being
    equivalent (i.e. supercell_matrix a diagonal matrix with ngqpt as diagonal
    elements). Non diagonal supercell_matrix are allowed as well, but the information
    encoded in the DDB will be the result of an interpolation done through phonopy.

    Phonopy is used to convert the IFC to the dynamical matrix. However, in order to
    determine the list of q-points in the irreducible Brillouin zone and to prepare the
    base for the final DDB file, abinit will be called for a very short and inexpensive run.

    Performs a check to verify if the two codes identify the same symmetries and it gives a
    warning in case of failure. Mismatching symmetries may lead to incorrect conversions.

    Args:
        unit_cell: a |Structure| object that identifies the unit cell used for the phonopy
            calculation.
        supercell_matrix: a 3x3 array representing the supercell matrix used to generated the
            forces with phonopy.
        out_ddb_path: a full path to the file where the new DDB will be written
        ngqpt: a list of 3 elements indicating the grid of q points that will be used in the DDB.
        qpt_list: alternatively to ngqpt an explicit list of q-points can be provided here.
            At least one among ngqpt and qpt_list should be defined.
        force_constants: an array with shape (num atoms unit cell, num atoms supercell, 3, 3)
            containing the force constants. Alternatively a string with the path to the
            FORCE_CONSTANTS file. This or force_set should be defined. If both given this
            has precedence.
        force_sets: a dictionary obtained from the force sets generated with phonopy.
            Alternatively a string with the path to the FORCE_SETS file. This or force_constants
            should be defined.
        born: a dictionary with "dielectric" and "born" keywords as obtained from the nac_params
            in phonopy. Alternatively a string with the path to the BORN file. Notice that
            the "factor" attribute is not taken into account, so the values should be in
            default phonopy units.
        primitive_matrix: a 3x3 array with the primitive matrix passed to Phonopy. "auto" will
            use spglib to try to determine it automatically. If the DDB file should contain the
            actual unit cell this should be the identity matrix.
        symprec: distance tolerance in Cartesian coordinates to find crystal symmetry in phonopy.
            It might be that the value should be tuned so that it leads to the the same symmetries
            as in the abinit calculation.
        tolsym: Gives the tolerance to identify symmetries in abinit. See abinit documentation for
            more details.
        supercell: if given it should represent the supercell used to get the force constants,
            without any perturbation. It will be used to match it to the phonopy supercell
            and sort the IFC in the correct order.
        calculator: a string with the name of the calculator. Will be used to set the conversion
            factor for the force constants coming from phonopy.
        manager: |TaskManager| object. If None, the object is initialized from the configuration file
        pseudos: List of filenames or list of |Pseudo| objects or |PseudoTable| object. It will be
            used by abinit to generate the base DDB file. If None the abipy.data.hgh_pseudos.HGH_TABLE
            table will be used.
        verbose: verbosity level. Set it to a value > 0 to get more information
        workdir: path to the directory where the abinit calculation will be executed.

    Returns:
        a DdbFile instance of the file written in out_ddb_path.

    """
    Converts the files produced by TDEP to an abinit DDB file. If the lotosplitting
    file is provided the BEC and dielectric tensor will also be added to the DDB.

    The conversion is performed by first extracting the force constants in phonopy format
    and then using phonopy_to_abinit_py to generate the DDB file. See the phonopy_to_abinit_py
    docstring for further details about the second step of the conversion.
    Notice that the supercell used by TDEP should be provided in order to properly
    sort the IFC to match the order required by phonopy.

    Args:
        unit_cell: a |Structure| object that identifies the unit cell used for the TDEP
            calculation.
        fc_path: the path to the forceconstants file produced by TDEP.
        supercell_matrix: a 3x3 array representing the supercell matrix used to generated the
            forces with TDEP.
        supercell: the supercell used by TDEP to get the force constants, without any
            perturbation (usually named with extension ssposcar). It will be used to match it to
            the phonopy supercell and sort the IFC in the correct order.
        out_ddb_path: a full path to the file where the new DDB will be written
        ngqpt: a list of 3 elements indicating the grid of q points that will be used in the DDB.
        qpt_list: alternatively to ngqpt an explicit list of q-points can be provided here.
            At least one among ngqpt and qpt_list should be defined.
        primitive_matrix: a 3x3 array with the primitive matrix passed to Phonopy. "auto" will
            use spglib to try to determine it automatically. If the DDB file should contain the
            actual unit cell this should be the identity matrix.
        lotosplitting_path: path to the lotosplitting file produced by TDEP. If None no BEC
            contribution will be set to the DDB.
        symprec: distance tolerance in Cartesian coordinates to find crystal symmetry in phonopy.
            It might be that the value should be tuned so that it leads to the the same symmetries
            as in the abinit calculation.
        tolsym: Gives the tolerance to identify symmetries in abinit. See abinit documentation for
            more details.
        manager: |TaskManager| object. If None, the object is initialized from the configuration file
        pseudos: List of filenames or list of |Pseudo| objects or |PseudoTable| object. It will be
            used by abinit to generate the base DDB file. If None the abipy.data.hgh_pseudos.HGH_TABLE
            table will be used.
        verbose: verbosity level. Set it to a value > 0 to get more information
        workdir: path to the directory where the abinit calculation will be executed.

    Returns:
        a DdbFile instance of the file written in out_ddb_path.
