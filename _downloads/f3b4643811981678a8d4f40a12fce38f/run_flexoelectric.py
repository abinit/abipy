Flexoelectric Tensor
=====================

This example shows how to compute the dynamical matrix of GaP on user-defined q-mesh
including Born effective charges, the macroscopic dielectric matric and the dynamical quadrupoles Q*.
The final results (out_DDB, out_DVDB) will be produced automatically at the end of the run
and saved in ``flow_phonons_with_quad/outdata/``.

The Q* tensor may be needed to improve the accuracy of the Fourier interpolation of the phonon frequencies,
especially in the long-wavelength limit |q| --> 0.
This example is based on  <https://docs.abinit.org/tests/tutorespfn/Input/tlw_4.abi>
Note that only selected features are compatible with dynamical quadrupoles.
Please consult <https://docs.abinit.org/topics/longwave/>
