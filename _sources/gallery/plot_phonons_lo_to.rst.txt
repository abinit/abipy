Phonon Bands with LO-TO
=======================

This example shows how to plot the phonon band structure of AlAs
including the LO-TO splitting. See tutorial/lesson_rf2.html

    # Plot the phonon frequencies. Note that the labels for the q-points
    # are found automatically by searching in an internal database.
