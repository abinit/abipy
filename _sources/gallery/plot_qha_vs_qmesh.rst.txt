Quasi-harmonic approximation (convergence wrt Q-mesh)
=====================================================

This example shows how to use the GSR.nc and PHDOS.nc files computed with different volumes
to analyze the convergence of QHA thermodynamic properties with respect to the number of q-points
used to compute the phonon DOS.
