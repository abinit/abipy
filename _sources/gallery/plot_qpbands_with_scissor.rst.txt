GW with scissors operator
=========================

This example shows how to generate an energy-dependent scissors operator
by fitting the GW corrections as function of the KS eigenvalues.
We then use the scissors operator to correct the KS band structure
computed on a high symmetry k-path. Finally, the LDA and the QPState band
structure are plotted with matplotlib.
