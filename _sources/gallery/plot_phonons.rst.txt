    # Open PHBST file produced by anaddb and extract the phonon bands object.
    # (alternatively one can use the shell and `abiopen.py OUT_PHBST.nc -nb`
    # to open the file in a jupyter notebook.

    # are found automatically in an internal database.
    phbands.plot(units="cm-1", title="AlAs without LO-TO splitting")

    # Alternatively you can use the optional argument qlabels
    # that defines the mapping reduced_coordinates --> name of the q-point.

    # and pass it to the plot method:
