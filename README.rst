About
=====

AbiPy is a Python_ library to analyze the results produced by Abinit_,
an open-source program for the ab-initio calculations of the physical properties of materials
within Density Functional Theory and Many-Body perturbation theory.
It also provides tools to generate input files and workflows to automate
ab-initio calculations and typical convergence studies.
AbiPy is interfaced with pymatgen_ and this allows users to
benefit from the different tools and python objects available in the pymatgen ecosystem.

The official documentation of the stable version is available at the `abipy docpage`_.
while the documentation of the **developmental** version is hosted on `github pages <http://abinit.github.io/abipy>`_.

AbiPy can be used in conjunction with matplotlib_, pandas_, scipy_, seaborn_, ipython_ and jupyter_ notebooks
thus providing a powerful and user-friendly environment for data analysis and visualization.
Check out our `gallery of plotting scripts <http://abinit.github.io/abipy/gallery/index.html>`_
and the `gallery of AbiPy workflows <http://abinit.github.io/abipy/flow_gallery/index.html>`_.

To learn more about the integration between jupyter_ and AbiPy, visit `our collection of notebooks
<https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/abinit/abitutorials/blob/master/abitutorials/index.ipynb>`_
or click the **Launch Binder** badge to start a Docker image with Abinit, AbiPy and all the other python dependencies
required to run the code inside the jupyter notebooks.
The notebook will be opened in your browser after building.

AbiPy is free to use. However, we also welcome your help to improve this library by making your own contributions.
Please report any bugs and issues at AbiPy's `Github page <https://github.com/abinit/abipy>`_.

.. important::

    Note that the majority of the post-processing tools available in AbiPy require output files in
    netcdf_ format so we **strongly** suggest to compile Abinit with netcdf support
    (use ``--with_trio_flavor="netcdf-fallback"`` at configure time to activate the internal netcdf library,
    to link Abinit against an external netcdf library please consult the configuration examples provided by abiconfig_).

Getting AbiPy
=============

Stable version
--------------

The version at the Python Package Index (PyPI) is always the latest stable release
that can be installed with::

    pip install abipy

Note that you may need to install pymatgen and other critical dependencies manually.
In this case, please consult the detailed installation instructions provided by the
`pymatgen howto <http://pymatgen.org/index.html#standard-install>`_ to install pymatgen 
and then follow the instructions in `our howto <http://abinit.github.io/abipy/installation>`_.

The installation process is greatly simplified if you install the required 
python packages through `Anaconda <https://continuum.io/downloads>`_.
We routinely use conda_ to test new developments with multiple Python versions and multiple virtual environments.
The anaconda distribution already provides the most critical dependencies (matplotlib_, scipy_, numpy_, netcdf4-python_)
in the form of pre-compiled packages that can be easily installed with e.g.::

    conda install numpy scipy netcdf4

To install AbiPy with conda, download the `miniconda installer <https://conda.io/miniconda.html>`_
(select python3.6 and the version corresponding to your operating system).
Create a new conda_ environment (let's call it ``abipy3.6``) based on python3.6 with::

    conda create --name abipy3.6 python=3.6

and activate it with::

    source activate abipy3.6

You should see the name of the conda environment in the shell prompt.

Now add ``conda-forge``, ``matsci`` and ``abinit`` to your conda channels with::

    conda config --add channels conda-forge
    conda config --add channels matsci
    conda config --add channels abinit

These are the channels from which we will download pymatgen, abipy and abinit.

Finally, install AbiPy from the abinit-channel_ with::

    conda install abipy -c abinit

One of the big advantages of conda over pip is that conda can also install 
libraries and executables written in Fortran.
For example, one can easily install abinit inside the conda environment with::

    conda install abinit -c abinit
    abinit --version

Additional information on the steps required to install AbiPy with anaconda are available
in the `anaconda howto <http://abinit.github.io/abipy/installation#anaconda-howto>`_.

We are also collaborating with the spack_ community
to provide packages for AbiPy and Abinit in order to facilitate the installation on large supercomputing centers.

Developmental version
---------------------

Getting the developmental version of AbiPy is easy. 
Clone the `github repository <https://github.com/abinit/abipy>`_ with::

    git clone https://github.com/abinit/abipy

For pip, use::

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    pip install -r requirements-optional.txt

If you are using conda_,  create a new environment (``abipy3.6``) based on python3.6 with::

    conda create -n abipy3.6 python=3.6
    source activate abipy3.6

Add ``conda-forge``, ``matsci`` and ``abinit`` to your channels with::

    conda config --add channels conda-forge
    conda config --add channels matsci
    conda config --add channels abinit

and install the AbiPy dependencies with::

    conda install --file ./requirements.txt
    conda install --file ./requirements-optional.txt

The second command is needed for Jupyter only.
Once the requirements have been installed (either with pip or conda), execute::

    python setup.py install

or alternately::

    python setup.py develop

to install the package in developmental mode. 
This is the recommended approach, especially if you are planning to implement new features.

Note, however, that the developmental version of AbiPy is kept in sync with the
developmental version of pymatgen thus ```python setup.py develop``` may 
try to download new versions from the PyPi portal and then fail with e.g. the error message::

    ...
    processing dependencies for abipy==0.6.0.dev0
    error: scipy 1.0.0 is installed but scipy>=1.0.1 is required by {'pymatgen'}

due to inconsistent dependencies.
To solve the problem, use conda to update scipy to a version >= 1.0.1 with::

    conda install "scipy>=1.0.1"

then issue again python setup.py develop. If this fails, supposing you were upgrading abipy inside an already existing conda environment, try to restart by creating from scratch a fresh conda environment, see above.

Use::

    conda info pymatgen

to display information about the installed version of pymatgen.

Also note that the BLAS/Lapack libraries provided by conda have multithreading support activated by default.
Each process will try to use all of the cores on your machine, which quickly overloads things 
if there are multiple processes running. 
(Also, this is a shared machine, so it is just rude behavior in general).
To disable multithreading, add these lines to your ~/.bash_profile::

    export OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1
    export OMP_NUM_THREADS=1

and then activate these settings with::

    source ~/.bash_profile

The Github version include test files for complete unit testing.
To run the suite of unit tests, make sure you have pytest_ installed and then type::

    pytest

in the AbiPy root directory. A quicker check might be obtained with 

    pytest abipy/core/tests -v

Unit tests require ``scripttest`` that can be installed with::

    pip install scripttest

Two tests rely on the availability of a 
`pymatgen PMG_MAPI_KEY <http://pymatgen.org/usage.html#setting-the-pmg-mapi-key-in-the-config-file>` in ~/.pmgrc.yaml.

Note that several unit tests check the integration between AbiPy and Abinit. 
In order to run the tests, you need a working set of Abinit executables and  a ``manager.yml`` configuration file.
A pre-compiled sequential version of Abinit for Linux and OSx can be installed directly from the 
abinit-channel_ with::

    conda install abinit -c abinit

For further information on the syntax of the configuration file, please consult the 
`workflows docs <http://abinit.github.io/abipy/workflows/taskmanager.html>`_ section.

Contributing to AbiPy is relatively easy.
Just send us a `pull request <https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/>`_.
When you send your request, make ``develop`` the destination branch on the repository
AbiPy uses the `Git Flow <http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/>`_ branching model.
The ``develop`` branch contains the latest contributions, and ``master`` is always tagged and points
to the latest stable release.

Using AbiPy
===========

Basic usage
-----------

There are a variety of ways to use AbiPy, and most of them are illustrated in the ``abipy/examples`` directory.
Below is a brief description of the different directories found there:

  * `examples/plot <http://abinit.github.io/abipy/gallery/index.html>`_

    Scripts showing how to read data from netcdf files and produce plots with matplotlib_

  * `examples/flows <http://abinit.github.io/abipy/flow_gallery/index.html>`_.

    Scripts showing how to generate an AbiPy flow, run the calculation and use ipython to analyze the data.

Additional jupyter notebooks with the Abinit tutorials written with AbiPy are available in the
`abitutorial repository <https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/abinit/abitutorials/blob/master/abitutorials/index.ipynb>`_

Users are strongly encouraged to explore the detailed `API docs <http://abinit.github.io/abipy/api/index.html>`_.
